### Missing Enterprise Features
- ‚ùå SOC 2 certification (required for enterprise)
- ‚ùå Multi-tenancy (single-tenant architecture)
- ‚ùå Advanced permissioning (role-based only)
- ‚ùå Audit logging (basic console logging only)
- ‚ùå Data encryption at rest
- ‚ùå Rate limiting
- ‚ùå Production monitoring (no APM, no error tracking)
