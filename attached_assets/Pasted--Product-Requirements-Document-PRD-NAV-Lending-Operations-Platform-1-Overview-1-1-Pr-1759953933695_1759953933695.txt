# Product Requirements Document (PRD): NAV Lending Operations Platform

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Product Name
NAV Lending Operations Platform (tentative: "AlphaNAV" – emphasizing operational alpha in NAV lending).

### 1.2 Product Description
This platform is designed to streamline and automate key operations in NAV (Net Asset Value) lending for private equity (PE) funds and lenders. The core goal is to achieve 100 basis points (bps) in operational alpha by reducing manual processes, enhancing efficiency, and enabling scalable origination and management. It positions the company as the "LP-friendly Chick-fil-A of NAV lending" – reliable, efficient, and investor-aligned.

The platform targets internal operations (underwriting, monitoring, reporting, and legal templating) while laying the foundation for external features like origination and LP enablement. It focuses on automating 90%+ of human-involved tasks in underwriting and providing predictive tools for deal sourcing.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- **Internal Users**: Operations teams, underwriters, compliance officers, legal teams, and investment committees (ICs) within the lending firm.
- **External Users (Future Phases)**: PE fund managers, limited partners (LPs), and potential borrowers for origination and education tools.
- **Key Stakeholders**: LPs, ICs, and fundraisers seeking efficient reporting and compliance.

### 1.4 Business Goals
- Achieve 100bps operational alpha through automation and efficiency gains.
- Reduce human involvement in underwriting from data/doc dump to IC memo by 90%+.
- Enable quarterly monitoring and reporting with minimal manual effort.
- Support fundraising by providing high-quality, trackable metrics and reports.
- Identify and engage 200-500+ potential funds annually via predictive analytics.
- Promote ILPA-aligned (Institutional Limited Partners Association) practices for NAV readiness among PE funds.

### 1.5 Success Metrics
- **Operational Efficiency**: Time saved per deal (target: 90% automation in underwriting); quarterly monitoring/reporting cycle reduced to <1 week.
- **Deal Flow**: Increase in qualified leads from origination tools (target: 20% conversion from predictive analysis).
- **User Adoption**: 80%+ internal team usage within first quarter; positive NPS from external users.
- **Financial Impact**: Contribution to fundraising (e.g., track additional $$$ raised via reports); reduction in operational costs by 50bps+.

## 2. Scope
### 2.1 In-Scope
- Core dashboard, table interface, and reporting tools.
- Internal operations modules: Underwriting, Monitoring, Reporting, Legal Templating.
- Phase 2 external features: Origination identification and engagement.
- Phase 3 external features: LP enablement and education tools.
- Integration with CRMs (e.g., Folk), LinkedIn APIs, and document upload portals.

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope
- Full CRM development (leverage integrations instead).
- Advanced AI/ML models beyond basic predictive analysis (e.g., no real-time trading integrations).
- Compliance with non-US regulations (focus on US/ILPA standards initially).
