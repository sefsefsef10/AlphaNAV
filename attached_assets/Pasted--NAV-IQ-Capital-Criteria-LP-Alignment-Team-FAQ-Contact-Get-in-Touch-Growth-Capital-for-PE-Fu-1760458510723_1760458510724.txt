Term Sheet to Funding
Market Opportunity
A multi-billion dollar liquidity gap limits growth for thousands of lower-middle-market funds. NAV IQ exists to close that gap — efficiently, transparently, and on your terms.

The Problem We're Solving
A $50 Billion Bottleneck

More than 1,600 lower-middle market PE funds face the same challenge: capital timing doesn't match opportunity timing.

Your best portfolio company needs $10M for an accretive add-on. But your fund is past the investment period. Going back to LPs takes 6 months. The deal dies.

The traditional options all fail:
LP capital calls: Slow, politically complex, may violate fund terms
High-leverage NAV loans: 30-50% LTV creates LPAC friction and misalignment
Distribution recycling: Only works if you have recent exits
Doing nothing: Watch competitors acquire the asset you identified
NAV IQ exists to fix this.

Low-leverage (5-15% LTV), growth-focused facilities that fund value creation—not distributions. Transparent to LPs, fast to deploy, built for the GPs who don't fit the $1B+ fund profile.

What You Can Use It For

Follow-On Investments
Deploy $5-15M into outperforming portfolio companies without returning to LPs for special calls. Double down on what's working.

Add-On Acquisitions
Move on tuck-in opportunities before competitors do. Accelerate consolidation strategies when targets come to market.

Strategic Recapitalizations
Refinance portfolio company debt, extend runways, or optimize capital structures without full exits.

De Novo Launches
Fund new location openings, market entries, or product line expansions that create enterprise value.

The unifying principle:

Preserve equity. Amplify NAV. Move faster than your fund structure allows.

Why NAV IQ Is Different
Built for Alignment, Not Extraction

We learned from watching traditional NAV lending create LPAC headaches and misaligned incentives. NAV IQ is structured differently from day one.

Traditional NAV Lenders	NAV IQ Capital
30-50% LTV (high leverage)	5-15% LTV (conservative)
Distribution-focused	Growth-focused only
Opaque fees and terms	Transparent, ILPA-aligned
60-90 day close timelines	<30 days with tech-enabled diligence
One-size-fits-all	Customized to fund structure
Our Philosophy:

Disciplined capital and transparency are inseparable. Our facilities strengthen the fund and protect LP trust—no hidden leverage, no misaligned incentives.

ILPA-Aligned by Design

Our term sheets anticipate LPAC questions. Full disclosure, conservative structure, value-accretive use of proceeds only.

Our Team
The Discipline of Experience

NAV IQ was founded by operators who've deployed capital, scaled technology, and navigated institutional complexity. We're not financial engineers—we're former GPs, CCOs, and product builders who understand what sponsors actually need.

Scott Greenwood
Co-Founder & Partner

Over a decade in investment management, most recently as Principal and CCO at Stonepoint Capital, focused on sourcing and due diligence of private investments in real estate and private equity. CPA, BA in Accounting from Furman University.

Why it matters: Scott brings institutional underwriting discipline—the same rigor that protects LPs—with the speed and pragmatism that GPs demand.

Jonah Hescock
Co-Founder & Partner

Senior roles across multiple PE and real estate firms, including Regional Leasing & Acquisitions Officer at EQT Exeter, Principal at Covenant Capital Management, and Director at Rubicon Equities. BS in Accounting and BBA in Finance (summa cum laude) from University of Kentucky, MS in Finance from Vanderbilt Owen.

Why it matters: Jonah has lived in the trenches of deal execution—he knows what kills transactions and how to structure capital that actually gets deployed.

Shane Fitch
Co-Founder & Partner

Most recently President at Documo, where he led AI-driven intelligent document processing platforms serving thousands of healthcare organizations. 10+ years scaling SaaS products in regulated industries.

Why it matters: Shane's automation infrastructure is what allows NAV IQ to serve the lower-middle market profitably—bringing institutional speed and quality to sponsors who've been underserved by technology.

Strategic Advisors
Brince Wilford
Advisor & Managing Partner

Co-founded CCM in 1999, growing it to over $500M in client assets across quantitative and systematic strategies. Previously Officer and SVP of Acquisitions for Healthcare Realty Trust, leading $600M+ in acquisitions and development.

Why it matters: Brince brings 25+ years of alternative asset management and institutional capital deployment experience—strategic guidance on underwriting, risk management, and LP communication.

Why Now
The Window Is Open

Three market forces make 2025 the right time for disciplined NAV capital:

Exit Markets Remain Uncertain
Hold periods are extending. The best funds need bridge capital to optimize exits rather than rushing to liquidity.

LP Fundraising Is Harder
Institutional allocators are overallocated to PE. Special calls and co-invests face more scrutiny than ever.

Opportunities Don't Wait
Add-on targets, follow-on rounds, and strategic initiatives appear on unpredictable timelines. Funds need optionality.

NAV IQ gives ambitious GPs the flexibility to operate on opportunity timelines—not fund cycle timelines.
