TIER 2: Competitive Defense (Do If Time Permits)
3. Lightweight NAV Valuation Module (73 Strings Defense)
Why It Matters:

73 Strings' biggest advantage is their 73 Value valuation suite
You don't need to match them, but absence is a red flag for enterprise buyers
NAV lending requires quarterly NAV marks‚Äîyou should facilitate this
What to Build:

Simplified Valuation Workflow (NOT full DCF like 73 Strings)

Features:
‚úÖ Mark-to-Market NAV Tracking
   - Upload quarterly NAV statements (PDF/Excel)
   - AI extraction of NAV value, date, portfolio company count
   - Historical NAV trend chart

‚úÖ LTV Auto-Recalculation
   - New NAV: $180M (down from $200M)
   - Outstanding loan: $10M
   - New LTV: 5.6% (was 5.0%)
   - Covenant status: ‚úÖ Compliant (threshold: 15%)

‚úÖ Portfolio Company Roll-Up
   - Extract individual holding values
   - Flag concentration risk (single holding >20% of NAV)
   - Alert if top 3 holdings declined >30%

DON'T Build:
‚ùå Full DCF modeling (73 Strings territory)
‚ùå Comp analysis (not needed for NAV lending)
‚ùå Waterfall calculations (GP/LP splits)
Implementation:

Effort: 25-35 hours
Tech: Extend portfolioExtraction.ts service
Schema: Already exists (portfolio_holdings table)
Business Impact:

Removes objection: "You can't track NAV values over time"
Enables automated LTV covenant monitoring (your core value prop)
Does NOT compete with 73 Strings (they do full valuations, you do NAV tracking)
Verdict: üü° NICE TO HAVE - Closes a gap but not critical for differentiation.

4. Market Intelligence Dashboard (Advisor Power Tool)
Current Status: Schema exists (market_intelligence table) but NO UI IMPLEMENTATION

Why It Matters:

Advisors need "What's market pricing?" to negotiate for GPs
73 Strings doesn't serve advisors (you do)
Network effects: More deals ‚Üí better market data ‚Üí more advisors
What to Build:

Advisor Market Intelligence Page

Real-Time Benchmarks (Anonymized):
1. NAV Lending Pricing Trends
   - Median LTV by fund size: $100M-$200M ‚Üí 12% LTV
   - Interest rate spread: SOFR + 6.5% - 8.5%
   - Avg time to term sheet: 6.2 days

2. Deal Volume Tracker
   - NAV facilities closed this quarter: 47 deals
   - Total volume: $2.3B (up 18% YoY)
   - By sector: Tech 32%, Healthcare 28%, Industrials 22%

3. Lender Appetite Index
   - "High appetite" lenders: 12 active
   - Avg bid count per RFP: 4.3 lenders
   - Win rate by lender (anonymized)

4. Commission Benchmarking
   - Median advisor fee: 62 bps
   - Range: 50-75 bps
   - By deal size: <$20M ‚Üí 75 bps, >$50M ‚Üí 50 bps

Data Sources:
- Internal: AlphaNAV deals (as volume grows)
- External: Scrape press releases, PitchBook, Preqin
- AI-enriched: Gemini extracts pricing from public filings
Implementation:

Effort: 20-30 hours (UI + data aggregation)
Tech: Build client/src/pages/market-intelligence.tsx (file exists but may be incomplete)
Schema: ‚úÖ Already exists (market_intelligence table in schema.ts)
Business Impact:

Advisor stickiness: Advisors need market data to negotiate ‚Üí platform lock-in
Network effects: More advisors ‚Üí more deals ‚Üí better data
Differentiation: 73 Strings has no advisor tools
Verdict: üü° RECOMMEND IF TARGETING ADVISORS - High ROI for marketplace dynamics.

5. 73 Strings API Integration (Complementary Positioning)
Why It Matters:

Positions AlphaNAV as "best-of-breed NAV module" vs. "73 Strings replacement"
Enterprise customers often have 73 Strings already‚Äîlet them use both
Integration partnership ‚Üí acquisition conversation
What to Build:

"Powered by 73 Strings" Integration

Workflow:
1. AlphaNAV customer also uses 73 Strings for broad portfolio monitoring
2. When NAV deal closes, push facility data to 73 Strings via API
3. 73 Strings monitors covenant compliance
4. 73 Strings pushes breach alerts back to AlphaNAV
5. AlphaNAV triggers lender notifications + GP communications

Technical:
‚úÖ OAuth connection to 73 Strings API (if they offer public API)
‚úÖ Bi-directional sync: Facilities, covenants, NAV values
‚úÖ "Import from 73 Strings" button in AlphaNAV UI

Strategic Benefit:
- AlphaNAV: "We integrate with 73 Strings" (credibility)
- 73 Strings: Sees AlphaNAV data ‚Üí realizes acquisition opportunity
Implementation:

Effort: 40-60 hours (depends on 73 Strings API availability)
Risk: 73 Strings may not have public API (enterprise only)
Alternative: Build generic "Export to 73 Strings CSV" format
Business Impact:

Partnership path: Joint marketing ‚Üí acquisition discussions
Enterprise sales: "We work with your existing tools"
Acquisition catalyst: 73 Strings sees your customer overlap
Verdict: üü¢ STRATEGIC PLAY - Low effort if API exists, high acquisition signal.
