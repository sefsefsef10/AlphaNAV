🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (Blocking Core Use Cases)
1. Authentication & User Management
Affects: All users | Impact: Cannot go live without this

❌ No signup/login system
❌ No password hashing or secure authentication
❌ No role-based access control (profiles aren't real users)
❌ No multi-factor authentication
❌ No tenant isolation between advisors/GPs/lenders
❌ No audit logging
2. Data Persistence
Affects: All users | Impact: All data lost on restart

❌ Currently using in-memory storage only
❌ Need PostgreSQL implementation for all tables
❌ No migration strategy
3. Operations Team Workflow Automation
Affects: NAV IQ Capital Team | Impact: Cannot execute lending operations

❌ Underwriting page is just a mock - no real workflow engine
❌ Monitoring page is static - no covenant tracking automation
❌ Portfolio page shows fake data - no real loan management
❌ Legal page has no document generation capability
❌ Reports page cannot generate actual IC/LP reports
These gaps prevent the 90% effort reduction and 100 bps operational alpha goals
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY GAPS
Advisor Portal - Cannot Fully Manage Competitive RFPs
Missing Core Features:
❌ Active RFPs page is placeholder - needs full deal tracking interface
❌ My Clients page is placeholder - cannot manage GP portfolio
❌ No lender matchmaking - advisors can select lenders but can't send invitations
❌ No term sheet comparison - cannot collect/compare competing offers
❌ No commission tracking/settlement - can see metrics but can't confirm payments
❌ No deal anonymization controls - cannot toggle GP identity disclosure
❌ No messaging/clarifications - cannot manage Q&A between GPs and lenders
❌ No document sharing - cannot send data packs to lenders securely
Specific Workflow Gaps:
After RFP submission: No way to invite lenders or track their responses
Term sheet collection: Lenders can't submit term sheets through the platform
Side-by-side comparison: No interface to compare multiple lender offers
Winner selection: No workflow to select winning lender and close RFP
Commission calculation: Metrics show but can't confirm actual payments
GP Portal - Journey Ends After Onboarding
Affects: GP/Fund Managers | Impact: Cannot use platform beyond initial application

Missing Features:
❌ No GP dashboard - GPs have no place to return to after onboarding
❌ No application status tracking - cannot see underwriting progress
❌ No facility dashboard - if approved, no way to manage their loan
❌ No covenant compliance view - cannot track their own performance
❌ No draw requests - cannot request capital drawdowns
❌ No document vault - cannot access loan documents, term sheets
❌ No repayment tracking - cannot see amortization schedule
❌ No messaging - cannot communicate with NAV IQ Capital team
❌ No reporting access - cannot get quarterly reports for LPs
Current State: GP applies → onboarding completes → dead end (nowhere to go)
