  - ✓ Track Record (10/10): GP has strong performance history
  - ✓ Diversification (9/10): Well-diversified across 12 companies
  - ✓ Liquidity (8/10): No near-term capital calls planned
  - ✓ Portfolio Quality (7/10): 2 companies underperforming vs. plan

#### Workflow 3.2: Quarterly Covenant Monitoring

**Scenario**: It's Q4 2025, and the operations team needs to monitor covenants across 20 active facilities totaling $180M in commitments

**Step 1: Automated Data Collection (Background Process)**
- AlphaNAV integrates with fund administrators (SS&C, Alter Domus) via API
- Pulls latest NAV data for all 20 funds automatically on quarterly reporting dates
- Sends reminders to GPs who haven't submitted quarterly reports by due date

**Step 2: Covenant Calculation (Automated)**
- Platform calculates 4 covenant types across 20 facilities (80 total covenant checks):
  - LTV: Current loan balance ÷ Latest NAV
  - Minimum NAV: Latest NAV vs. covenant threshold
  - Diversification: Largest portfolio company concentration vs. limit
  - Liquidity: Cash reserves vs. minimum required

**Step 3: Breach Detection & Alerts (Real-Time)**
- AlphaNAV identifies 3 covenant issues:
  - **Fund Alpha Healthcare**: LTV 17.2% (threshold 18%, WARNING - within 10%)
  - **Fund Beta Industrial**: Minimum NAV $78M (threshold $80M, BREACH)
  - **Fund Gamma Tech**: Diversification 16% (threshold 15%, BREACH)
- Slack alert sent immediately: "⚠️ 2 covenant breaches detected - Fund Beta, Fund Gamma"
- Email summary to operations VP with detailed breach report

**Step 4: User Investigation (30 minutes per breach)**

**Fund Beta Industrial Breach**:
- User clicks into Fund Beta dashboard
- Reviews breach details: NAV declined from $85M (Q3) to $78M (Q4) due to portfolio company write-down
- Platform shows: "NAV decreased 8.2% vs. Q3. Primary driver: Company XYZ write-down -$7M"
- Checks breach prediction: "30-day probability of LTV breach: 65% if NAV decline continues"

- Clicks "Generate Breach Notice" (auto-populates template letter to GP)
- Requests updated valuation report for portfolio companies
- Schedules call with GP: "Discuss path to cure breach within 30 days"
- Logs all actions in platform audit trail (required for compliance)

**Fund Gamma Tech Breach**:
- Reviews diversification breach: Largest holding (Company ABC) now represents 16% of NAV
- Platform shows: "Company ABC grew from 12% to 16% due to 33% valuation increase"
- This is a "good news breach" - company performing well, but violates concentration covenant

**User Actions**:
- Documents breach with note: "Technical breach due to portfolio company appreciation"
- Sends GP options: (1) Obtain waiver from LP advisory committee, or (2) Request covenant amendment
- Platform tracks resolution timeline: "Cure deadline: January 15, 2026"

**Step 5: Compliance Reporting (15 minutes)**
- User exports quarterly covenant compliance report for internal audit
- Platform generates 12-page PDF showing:
  - All 20 facilities with covenant status (17 compliant, 1 warning, 2 breaches)
  - Breach resolution tracking with GP communication logs
  - Portfolio-level risk metrics (avg LTV 13.8%, diversification across 180 portfolio companies)

**Total Time: 90 minutes for full portfolio** (vs. 160-240 hours manually)

**User Thoughts**:
- *"We caught the Fund Beta breach the day the NAV report came in - would've missed it for weeks previously"*
- *"The automated calculations eliminate our manual spreadsheet errors"*

**User Experience**:
- Platform visualizes breach probability by facility (color-coded risk map)
- Identifies most vulnerable facilities: "Fund Gamma Tech has 85% breach probability under -30% scenario"
