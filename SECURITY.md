# AlphaNAV Security & Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines AlphaNAV's security architecture, data protection measures, and compliance readiness for SOC 2 Type II certification.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Primary Auth**: Replit OIDC (OpenID Connect) with session-based authentication
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with `connect-pg-simple`
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Four user roles with hierarchical permissions
  - `operations`: Full system access
  - `advisor`: Deal submission and RFP management
  - `gp`: Facility management and document access
  - `admin`: System administration
- **Multi-Tenancy**: GP users isolated to their own data via `advisorId` scoping
- **API Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for public API access with scoped permissions

### Data Encryption
- **In Transit**: All connections use TLS 1.2+
- **At Rest**: PostgreSQL data encrypted at rest (Neon provides encryption)
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables managed by Replit Secrets
- **Sensitive Fields**: API keys, client secrets stored hashed (bcrypt equivalent)
- **PII Protection**: Email addresses, phone numbers, financial data encrypted in database

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for all API inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM
- **XSS Prevention**: React auto-escaping, Content Security Policy headers
- **CSRF Protection**: Session-based CSRF tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Express rate-limit middleware (100 req/15min default)

### API Security
- **OAuth 2.0 Server**: Client credentials and authorization code flows
- **API Rate Limiting**: Per-client rate limits (default 1000 req/hour)
- **Scope-Based Permissions**: Granular scopes (e.g., `read:facilities`, `write:draws`)
- **Request Logging**: All API calls logged with client ID, endpoint, status
- **IP Allowlisting**: Optional IP restrictions per API client
- **Webhook Signing**: HMAC signatures for outbound webhooks

### Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All CRUD operations logged to `audit_logs` table
- **Tracked Fields**:
  - User ID and role
  - Action type (created, updated, deleted, approved, rejected)
  - Entity type and ID
  - Before/after state (JSON diff)
  - IP address and user agent
  - Timestamp
- **Retention**: 7-year retention for financial audit compliance
- **Immutability**: Audit logs are write-only (no updates/deletes)

### Data Integrity
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign keys, NOT NULL, UNIQUE constraints
- **Transaction Management**: Critical operations wrapped in transactions
- **Backup & Recovery**: Daily automated backups (Neon), 30-day retention
- **Referential Integrity**: User ID preservation on email conflicts
- **Checksums**: SHA256 checksums for document deduplication and integrity

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Whitelist-based MIME type checking
- **Size Limits**: 50MB per file, 50 files per batch
- **Virus Scanning**: (Recommended for production: ClamAV integration)
- **Storage**: Replit Object Storage with access controls
- **Deduplication**: SHA256 checksums prevent duplicate storage
