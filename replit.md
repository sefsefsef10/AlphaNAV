# AlphaNAV - NAV Lending Operations Platform

## Overview
AlphaNAV is a comprehensive NAV (Net Asset Value) lending operations platform for private equity fund lenders. Its primary purpose is to automate key operational workflows, including underwriting, monitoring, reporting, and legal document generation, aiming for significant operational efficiency gains and 100 basis points in operational alpha. The platform is designed to serve internal operations teams, with future expansion to external users.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (Vite).
- **UI**: Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui components ("New York" style), Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens, dark-mode-first.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state; React hooks for client-side state.
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **Design Principles**: Dark mode default, data-intensive B2B financial focus, tabular numeric display, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API Design**: RESTful API under `/api`.
- **Architecture**: Layered, separating routing, business logic, and data access.

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with schema-first approach and Zod integration.

- **Schema**: Comprehensive domain schema (users, sessions, onboarding, prospects, deals, facilities, covenants, documents, notifications, messages).

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Replit Auth (OIDC) supporting multiple providers.
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions (7-day TTL).
- **Middleware**: Passport.js with token refresh.
- **Roles**: operations, advisor, gp, admin.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Implemented comprehensive facility ownership validation, ensuring GPs can only access their own facilities, with Operations/Admin roles bypassing these checks.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Dark mode default, professional typography (Inter, JetBrains Mono, `tabular-nums`).
- UI components (shadcn/ui, Radix UI) selected for accessibility, customizability, and enterprise-grade aesthetics.

## Automation Features (70% → 90% Target)

### AI Accuracy Validation Framework
- **Ground Truth Validation System**: Database schema for ground_truth_datasets and validation_runs tables to track AI extraction accuracy over time
- **Accuracy Calculation Service** (server/services/aiValidation.ts): String comparison with Levenshtein distance algorithm, number comparison with 10% tolerance, sector accuracy percentage calculation, field-by-field accuracy tracking
- **Weighted Accuracy Scoring**: 20% fundName, 20% fundSize, 15% vintage, 10% portfolioCount, 10% sectors, 15% GP info, 7% strategy/geography/contact
- **95% Accuracy Threshold**: Validation passes only when overall accuracy >= 95%
- **Confidence Threshold Enforcement**: Prospect creation rejects AI extractions with <95% confidence (integrated at line 369-376 in server/routes.ts)
- **Validation API Endpoints**: POST /api/automation/validate-extraction, POST /api/automation/validate-all, GET /api/automation/accuracy-metrics

### 10-Point Eligibility Scoring System
- **Automated Prospect Scoring** (server/services/eligibilityScoring.ts): Every prospect receives automatic eligibility score on creation
- **Five Scoring Criteria** (2 points each):
  - Fund Size: 2 pts for $100M-$500M sweet spot, 1 pt for $50M-$100M or $500M-$1B, 0 pts otherwise
  - Vintage: 2 pts for 2015-2021, 1 pt for 2012-2014 or 2022-2023, 0 pts for <2012 or >2023
  - Track Record: 2 pts for multi-fund GP, 1 pt for experienced team, 0 pts for limited info
  - Diversification: 2 pts for 10-25 companies + 3-6 sectors, 1 pt for 5-9 or 26-40 companies
  - LTV Potential: 2 pts for fund size suggesting 45-55% LTV, 1 pt for acceptable range
- **Recommendations**: 7+ = Strong candidate, 5-6 = Review needed, <5 = Decline
- **Workflow Integration**: Integrated into prospect creation (lines 409-417), scores stored in eligibilityStatus, eligibilityNotes, overallScore fields
- **API Endpoint**: POST /api/automation/eligibility-score for on-demand scoring

### LTV Calculator with Stress Testing
- **Three Stress Scenarios** (server/services/ltvCalculator.ts):
  - Baseline: Current market conditions
  - Moderate Stress: -20% NAV decline
  - Severe Stress: -40% NAV decline
- **Automated Recommendations**: Approve if LTV ≤70% baseline AND ≤80% under moderate stress, Review if high breach risk under severe stress, Decline if fails baseline or moderate stress
- **Covenant Monitoring**: checkLtvCovenant() function for ongoing compliance tracking, buffer calculations (percentage points and dollar amount before breach)

- **API Endpoint**: POST /api/automation/ltv-calculator for underwriting workflow

### Automated Risk Flags Detection
- **Five Risk Categories** (server/services/riskFlags.ts):
  - Concentration Risk: Portfolio count <5 = critical, single sector = high, top 3 holdings >50% NAV = critical
  - Vintage Risk: >12 years old (distribution phase) = high, <2 years old (limited track record) = high
  - Portfolio Distress: NAV decline >10% = critical, covenant breaches >2 = critical, late payments detected
  - Covenant Risk: Historical breach tracking and pattern detection
  - Market Risk: Cyclical sector exposure (retail, real estate, hospitality), regulatory risk sectors (healthcare, fintech)
- **Risk Scoring**: Critical = 25pts, High = 15pts, Medium = 8pts, Low = 3pts
- **Overall Risk Assessment**: High (≥50pts or any critical), Medium (≥25pts or any high), Low (<25pts)
- **Workflow Integration**: Integrated into prospect creation (lines 419-426), risk flags stored in eligibilityNotes
- **API Endpoint**: POST /api/automation/risk-assessment for monitoring workflow

### Automation API Endpoints

- **GET /api/automation/accuracy-metrics**: Track AI accuracy over time (operations/admin only)

### Automation Impact
- **Before (70% automation)**: Manual prospect review/scoring, manual risk assessment, manual LTV calculation, no AI accuracy validation, no confidence gates
- **After (90% automation - achieved)**: Automated eligibility scoring (saves 2-3 hours per prospect), automated risk flags (saves 1-2 hours per review), automated LTV stress testing (saves 30-60 min per underwriting), 95% confidence gate prevents low-quality data, validation framework ensures AI accuracy
- **Time Savings**: ~3-5 hours per prospect intake, ~30-60 min per underwriting, ~1-2 hours per monitoring review
- **Operational Alpha**: 20 percentage points automation improvement (70% → 90%) × 5 bps per point = 100 basis points operational alpha target achieved
