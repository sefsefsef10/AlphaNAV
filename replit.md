# AlphaNAV - NAV Lending Operations Platform

## Overview
AlphaNAV is a comprehensive NAV (Net Asset Value) lending operations platform for private equity fund lenders. Its primary purpose is to automate key operational workflows, including underwriting, monitoring, reporting, and legal document generation, aiming for significant operational efficiency gains (100 basis points in operational alpha). The platform is designed to serve internal operations teams (underwriters, compliance officers, legal teams, investment committees) initially, with future expansion to external users (PE fund managers, limited partners). Key capabilities include reducing manual effort in underwriting by 90%+, enabling efficient quarterly monitoring, and supporting fundraising through automated report generation.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (Vite build tool).
- **UI Component System**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components ("New York" style variant), inspired by Carbon Design System for data density and professional aesthetics.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens, dark-mode-first interface, professional blue as primary, semantic colors for financial states.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query (v5) for server state; component-level state with React hooks for client-side.
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing.
- **Design Principles**: Dark mode default, data-intensive B2B financial focus, tabular numeric display, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, component composition with Radix UI slot pattern.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure under `/api` prefix.
- **Storage Layer**: Interface-based `IStorage` (currently in-memory `MemStorage`), designed for future migration to persistent databases.
- **Request Handling**: JSON and URL-encoded body parsing, request/response logging, centralized error handling.
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture separating routing, business logic, and data access.

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with a schema-first approach.
    - Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for type-safe sharing.
    - Drizzle Kit for migrations.
    - Zod integration via `drizzle-zod` for runtime validation.
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with Neon's serverless adapter using WebSocket.
- **Schema**: Minimal user table, extensible for NAV lending domain models.
- **Architecture**: Centralized database schema in `shared/` for full-stack type safety; serverless-first approach for scalability.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Current State**: Basic user schema exists, no active authentication implementation.
- **Session Management**: `connect-pg-simple` indicates planned PostgreSQL-backed session storage for Express.
- **Future**: Likely session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session store.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Dark mode as default, professional typography (Inter, JetBrains Mono), `tabular-nums` font variant for data.
- UI components (shadcn/ui, Radix UI) selected for accessibility, customizability, and enterprise-grade aesthetics.

### Technical Implementations
- Monorepo structure with shared types.
- Module path aliases (`@/`, `@shared/`, `@assets/`).
- Serverless-first database approach for scalability.
- Component library approach with shadcn/ui for consistent UI.

### Feature Specifications
- **Notification System**: Real-time notification center (bell icon, dropdown, priority coding, mark/delete actions, auto-refresh), user preferences page (channel toggles, type filters, delivery preferences).
- **GP Facility Management**: Draw requests (create, track, approve), repayment tracking, document vault (upload, list, download, delete), messaging system.
- **Global Search**: Cmd+K / Ctrl+K shortcut, real-time search across entities (GP deals, prospects, facilities, advisors), type-specific icons, click-to-navigate.
- **Data Export**: CSV export utility (generic `arrayToCSV`, `downloadCSV`), dashboard export buttons (Prospects, Deals, Facilities) with comprehensive column mappings, timestamped filenames.
- **Help System & Onboarding**: Dialog-based help center with tabbed navigation (Operations, Advisors, GP Users, FAQ), role-specific guides, prominent help button.

## External Dependencies

- **UI Component Libraries**: Radix UI, Recharts, cmdk, Lucide React.
- **Development Tools**: Vite, Replit-specific plugins, TypeScript.
- **Data & Validation**: Zod, React Hook Form with Zod resolvers, date-fns.
- **Styling & Design**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge.
- **Database & ORM**: @neondatabase/serverless, Drizzle ORM, ws (WebSocket).
- **Planned Third-Party Integrations**: LinkedIn APIs, CRM integrations (Folk), document upload/processing capabilities.

   - **Loan Agreement Template**: 7 articles (Definitions, Facility, Interest & Fees, Representations, Covenants, Events of Default, Miscellaneous)
   - **Term Sheet Template**: Table format with key terms, fees structure, covenants, closing conditions
   - **Compliance Report Template**: Standardized quarterly format (covenant compliance, NAV analysis, portfolio composition, payment history)
   - Conditional sections based on configuration (OID, PIK, amortization, prepayment penalties, security interest)
   - Uses actual facility data from schema fields (fundName, principalAmount, interestRate, ltvRatio, maturityDate, paymentSchedule)
   - Graceful fallback with placeholders for missing data

3. **API Endpoints** (`server/routes.ts`):
   - POST `/api/generate-document` - Generate & persist document (authenticated, Zod validated)
   - GET `/api/generated-documents` - List all generated documents (authenticated)
   - GET `/api/generated-documents/:id` - Get specific document (authenticated)
   - GET `/api/facilities/:facilityId/generated-documents` - Get facility's documents (authenticated)
   - DELETE `/api/generated-documents/:id` - Remove document (authenticated)

### October 23, 2025 - Covenant Monitoring and Compliance Tracking
**Status**: Task 11 COMPLETE

**Features Implemented**:
1. **Storage Layer** (`server/dbStorage.ts`):
   - `createCovenant`: Insert new covenant thresholds for facilities
   - `getCovenantsByFacility`: Retrieve all covenants for a specific facility
   - `updateCovenant`: Modify covenant thresholds or status (returns fresh state)
   - `checkCovenants`: Automated compliance checking with breach detection

2. **API Routes** (`server/routes.ts`):
   - GET `/api/facilities/:facilityId/covenants` - List covenants for facility
   - POST `/api/covenants` - Create new covenant (Zod validated)
   - PATCH `/api/covenants/:id` - Update covenant (field whitelisting)
   - POST `/api/facilities/:facilityId/check-covenants` - Run compliance check

3. **Automated Covenant Checking Logic**:
   - Compares currentValue vs thresholdValue based on operator
   - Supports 4 operators: less_than, less_than_equal, greater_than, greater_than_equal
   - Three status levels: compliant, warning (90-100% of threshold), breach (exceeds threshold)
   - Automatically creates urgent notifications when breach detected
   - Prevents duplicate breach notifications with breachNotified flag
   - Updates lastChecked timestamp on each check
   - **Zero-value safe**: Explicit null/undefined checks prevent skipping legitimate zero values

4. **Covenant Types Supported**:
   - LTV Covenant: Maximum loan-to-NAV ratio (conservative 5-15% target)
   - Minimum NAV: Fund must maintain minimum asset value
   - Diversification: Portfolio concentration limits
   - Liquidity: Minimum cash reserves required
   - Custom covenants: Flexible covenant_type field supports any threshold rule

5. **Compliance Workflow**:
   - Operations team defines covenant thresholds when setting up facility
   - Quarterly (or monthly/annual) automated checks compare actual vs threshold
   - Warning status triggers at 90% of breach threshold (early warning system)
   - Breach status creates urgent notification (only if facility has gpUserId)
   - If no owner: Logs warning, keeps breachNotified=false for retry on next check
   - Operations team can manually run checks via API endpoint

**Technical Highlights**:
- Type-safe covenant operations with Drizzle ORM
- Zod validation on covenant creation (insertCovenantSchema)
- Field whitelisting on updates prevents arbitrary field modification
- Threshold checking logic handles all comparison operators
- Warning thresholds provide early breach detection (90% for upper limits, 110% for lower limits)
- Notification system integration with conditional breachNotified flag
- Graceful degradation when facility has no owner (logs warning, retries later)
- Zero-value safe: Processes currentValue=0 correctly for all operators
- Extensible design supports any covenant type with threshold/operator pattern

**Architect Review Notes**:
- Core functionality complete and production-ready
- Recommended future enhancement: Automated regression tests for zero-value scenarios and missing-owner retries
