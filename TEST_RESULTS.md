## Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

### Minor LSP Type Issues
- **Location**: Legacy advisor routes (server/routes.ts)
- **Impact**: None - no runtime errors
- **Severity**: P3 (Low)
- **Action**: Can be fixed post-MVP

### Expected Behaviors
- **401 on /api/notifications**: Expected - requires authentication ✅
- **File upload size limit**: 10MB (by design) ✅
- **OIDC auth**: Limits automated e2e testing (use manual testing guide) ✅

---

## Untested Features (Require Manual Testing)

Due to OIDC authentication limitations with automated testing, the following features require manual browser testing:

### Priority 1 - Should Test Before Launch
1. **GP Onboarding Flow** (4 steps with document upload)
2. **Legal Document Generation UI** (loan agreement, term sheet, compliance report)
3. **Covenant Monitoring UI** (manual covenant checks)
4. **Global Search** (Cmd+K functionality)
5. **Notification Center** (bell icon, mark read/delete)

### Priority 2 - Can Test Post-Launch
6. **Advisor RFP Submission** (deal creation, lender invitations)
7. **GP Draw Requests** (facility draw management)
8. **Messaging System** (GP ↔ Operations communication)
9. **Help System** (dialog-based help center)
10. **CSV Exports** (prospects, deals, facilities)

**Recommendation**: Use MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md (52 test cases) for browser-based validation

- Graceful fallback to manual entry if extraction fails

### Gemini AI Breach Analysis
**Status**: ✅ **TESTED & PASSING**  
**Accuracy**: Correctly identified critical breach scenario  
**Performance**: <3s response time (well within <6s SLO)  
**Confidence**: High - risk level aligns with actual covenant statuses
