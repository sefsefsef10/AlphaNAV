## Success Metrics Tracking

### Current State (vs. User Journey Targets)

| Workflow | Target Time | Current Time | Status |
|----------|------------|--------------|--------|
| New deal underwriting | 45 min | ~40 min | ✅ Exceeds target |
| Quarterly covenant monitoring (20 facilities) | 90 min | 120+ min | 🟡 Needs fund admin integrations |
| Portfolio analytics for LP reporting | 36 min | 45-60 min | 🟡 Missing formatted templates |
| Advisor RFP process (mandate to close) | 15 days | 15-18 days | 🟡 Near target |
| GP facility draw request | 5 min | 5 min | ✅ Meets target |
| GP quarterly compliance | 10 min | 15-20 min | 🟡 Needs auto NAV pull |
| GP facility repayment | 5 min | 5-7 min | ✅ Near target |

### Value Proposition Gaps

| Metric | Target | Current | Gap |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| Operational alpha (bps) | 100+ | 85 (est.) | -15 bps (needs integrations) |

## Conclusion

AlphaNAV has built a **solid foundation** covering ~55% of the comprehensive user journey requirements. The platform excels at:

✅ **Core lending operations**: AI extraction, eligibility scoring, facility management
✅ **Covenant monitoring**: Automated calculations, breach prediction, notifications
✅ **Advisor RFP workflow**: Multi-lender bidding, term sheet comparison, commission tracking
✅ **GP onboarding**: Document upload, AI analysis, draw requests

**Critical gaps** preventing full 100bps operational alpha:
1. **No public marketing website** - blocks self-service GP acquisition
2. **No fund administrator integrations** - requires manual NAV data entry (adds 30+ min per quarter per facility)
3. **Limited GP self-service** - GPs must use advisors, can't access platform directly at scale
4. **No market intelligence** - advisors can't benchmark pricing or demonstrate value
5. **Missing analytics** - can't prove ROI to customers

**Recommendation**: Prioritize **Phase 1 (analytics) + Phase 2 (GP portal)** to unlock self-service growth and prove value proposition. Fund admin integrations (Phase 3) are critical for true "100 bps alpha" claim but require significant engineering effort.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate priorities with product team
2. Estimate engineering effort for each phase
3. Design technical architecture for fund admin integrations
4. Create marketing website wireframes
5. Build analytics tracking system
