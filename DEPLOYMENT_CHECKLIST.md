## üîí MANDATORY SECURITY HARDENING ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: All critical security controls implemented and tested

### 1. HTTP Security Headers (Helmet.js) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Implementation**: Environment-aware CSP with strict production policies

**Implemented Features**:
- [x] **Helmet.js configured** in server/index.ts
- [x] **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  - Font sources: Google Fonts (fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com)
  - Script sources: Self + development exceptions for Vite HMR
  - Connect sources: OpenAI, Gemini, Sentry (*.sentry.io, *.ingest.sentry.io)
  - Frame ancestors: 'none' (prevents clickjacking)
  - Script-src-attr: 'none' (prevents inline event handlers)
- [x] **HSTS**: 1 year max-age with subdomains and preload
- [x] **PII Scrubbing**: Sentry beforeSend hook removes auth headers, cookies, passwords
- [x] **Request Logging**: Only logs response metadata, not full payloads

**Verification**: Review server/index.ts lines 60-88

### 2. Rate Limiting ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Implementation**: Multi-tiered rate limiting applied before body parsing

**Implemented Features**:
- [x] **Global rate limiter**: 100 req/15min for all `/api/*` routes
- [x] **Auth login limiter**: 5 req/15min for `/api/login` and `/api/auth/callback`
- [x] **Auth refresh limiter**: 20 req/15min for `/api/auth/refresh` (separate from login)
- [x] **Applied BEFORE body parsing**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- [x] **Body size limits**: 10MB JSON/form payload limit

**Verification**: Review server/index.ts lines 90-120

### 3. Session Cookie Security ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Implementation**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with secure cookie configuration

**Implemented Features**:
- [x] **Session configuration** in server/replitAuth.ts
- [x] **Cookie security**:
  - httpOnly: true (prevents JavaScript access)
  - secure: conditional on NODE_ENV === "production" (HTTPS only in prod)
  - sameSite: "strict" (CSRF protection)
  - maxAge: 7 days (auto-expires)
- [x] **PostgreSQL session store**: connect-pg-simple with 7-day TTL

**Verification**: Review server/replitAuth.ts lines 35-46

### 4. Input Validation & Mass Assignment Protection ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Implementation**: Comprehensive Zod validation on all mutation endpoints

**Implemented Features**:
- [x] **All 7 critical POST/PATCH endpoints validated**:
  - `POST /api/prospects/upload-and-extract` - File upload with type validation
  - `PATCH /api/prospects/:id` - updateProspectSchema with .strict()
  - `POST /api/facilities` - insertFacilitySchema
  - `PATCH /api/facilities/:id` - updateFacilitySchema with .strict()
  - `POST /api/covenants` - insertCovenantSchema
  - `PATCH /api/covenants/:id` - updateCovenantSchema with .strict()
  - `POST /api/advisor-deals` - insertAdvisorDealSchema
- [x] **Mass assignment protection**: Update schemas use .strict() to reject unknown fields
- [x] **Protected fields**: Status/stage fields excluded from PATCH to require business logic
- [x] **Foreign key protection**: prospectId, facilityId, advisorDealId immutable in updates
- [x] **File upload validation**:
  - Allowed types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, TXT, CSV
  - Max size: 10MB (reduced from 50MB)
  - MIME type + extension validation

**Verification**: Review server/routes.ts lines 47-67 (update schemas) and lines 34-67 (file upload)

### 5. CORS Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED
**Status**: Using Vite default CORS (development mode)

**Production Action Required**:
- [ ] **Configure strict CORS** for production deployment
  - Whitelist only production domains (replit.app, custom domain)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps (Replit-Specific)

### Pre-Flight Checks
1. [ ] **Run Final Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Verify no build errors
   - Check bundle size (target: <2MB for initial load)
   - Review build output for warnings
   - Test built app locally: Build completes ‚Üí Test pages load

2. [ ] **Database Schema Validation**
   - **Option A**: Use Drizzle push (easier, recommended for MVP)
     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```
   - **Option B**: Generate and apply migrations (safer for production)
     ```bash
     npx drizzle-kit generate
     npx drizzle-kit migrate
     ```
   - [ ] Verify schema matches current database state
   - [ ] Test database connection after schema update
   - [ ] Document any manual data migrations needed

3. [ ] **Dependency Audit**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```
   - Fix high/critical vulnerabilities
   - Document accepted low/medium risks

### Deployment via Replit Deployments
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Replit Deployments differ from development environment

1. [ ] **Review Replit Deployment Settings**
   - Open Replit project ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Deployments tab
   - **CRITICAL**: Deployment runs `npm run dev` which is correct for this setup
   - Verify port 5000 is configured (frontend binds to 0.0.0.0:5000)
   - Confirm auto-deploy settings (deploy on push to main branch)

2. [ ] **Create Production Database Branch (Neon)**
   - [ ] Navigate to Neon dashboard ‚Üí Branches
   - [ ] Create new branch named "production" from current "main" branch
   - [ ] Copy the new production DATABASE_URL
   - [ ] **DO NOT** update dev database URL yet

3. [ ] **Configure Production Environment in Replit**
   - [ ] Open Replit ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Secrets (for production deployment)
   - [ ] Add/update production secrets:
     - `NODE_ENV=production`
     - `DATABASE_URL=<production-neon-url>` (from step 2)
     - `SENTRY_DSN=<your-sentry-dsn>`
     - `VITE_SENTRY_DSN=<your-frontend-sentry-dsn>`
   - [ ] Verify all other secrets are present (SESSION_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY)
   - [ ] **Note**: Cannot verify secrets via shell - use Replit Secrets UI

4. [ ] **Pre-Deployment Database Setup**
   - [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Temporarily set DATABASE_URL to production URL in dev environment
   - [ ] Run schema push to production database:
     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```
   - [ ] Verify schema created in production database (check Neon console)
   - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Restore DATABASE_URL to dev URL after schema push
   - [ ] Alternative: Run migrations in Replit Shell after deployment

5. [ ] **Deploy to Production**

     app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
       res.json({ status: 'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
     });
     ```
   - [ ] Replit uses this to monitor deployment health
   - [ ] Test after deployment: `curl https://<your-url>/api/health`

7. [ ] **Custom Domain Setup** (Optional)
   - [ ] Replit Deployments ‚Üí Domains
   - [ ] Add custom domain (e.g., `app.alphanav.com`)
   - [ ] Configure DNS records as instructed by Replit:
     - CNAME: `app.alphanav.com` ‚Üí `<repl-name>.<username>.repl.co`
   - [ ] Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)
   - [ ] SSL certificate auto-provisioned by Replit
   - [ ] Update CORS configuration with custom domain

  - Impact: Full system down
  - Mitigation: None for MVP (Replit is hosting platform)
  - Long-term: Consider multi-cloud strategy

- [ ] **Scenario 2: Neon Database Outage**
  - Likelihood: Very low (Neon has >99.95% uptime)
  - Impact: Full system down (app requires database)
  - Mitigation: Neon automatically fails over to replica
  - Action: Monitor Neon status page during outage

- [ ] **Scenario 3: Replit Auth (OIDC) Outage**
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Users cannot log in (existing sessions still work)
  - Mitigation: See "OIDC Provider Contingency" in Security section
  - Immediate action: Post status update to users

- [ ] **Scenario 4: OpenAI/Gemini API Outage**
  - Likelihood: Medium (APIs have occasional issues)
  - Impact: AI features broken (document analysis, covenant risk)
  - Mitigation: Graceful degradation to manual processes
  - Action: Display message to users about temporary AI unavailability

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
Rollback immediately if:
- Critical features are broken (login, data corruption)
- Error rate exceeds 10%
- Data loss or security vulnerability discovered
- Database migration failure

### Rollback Steps
1. **Replit Deployment Rollback**
   - Replit Deployments ‚Üí History
   - Select previous stable deployment
   - Click "Rollback to this deployment"
   - Verify rollback completes (~1-2 minutes)

2. **Database Rollback (if schema changed)**
   - Use Neon point-in-time recovery
   - Neon dashboard ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Restore to timestamp
   - Select timestamp before deployment
   - Update DATABASE_URL to restored branch

3. **Verify Rollback Success**
   - Run post-deployment verification tests
   - Check error rate returns to normal
   - Verify user functionality restored
   - Notify stakeholders of rollback

4. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
   - Review Sentry errors for root cause
   - Check deployment logs for failures
   - Document lessons learned
   - Plan fix before next deployment

## üìù Production Runbook

### Common Operations

#### Restart Application
```bash
# Via Replit console
npm run dev
```

#### Check Database Connection
```bash
# Test database connectivity
node -e "const { neon } = require('@neondatabase/serverless'); const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL); sql\`SELECT NOW()\`.then(r => console.log('DB connected:', r)).catch(e => console.error('DB error:', e));"
```

#### View Recent Errors
- Sentry dashboard ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Last 24 hours
- Sort by frequency or impact
- Filter by environment: production

#### Database Maintenance
```bash
# Run schema migrations (if needed)
npm run db:push

# Generate migration files
npx drizzle-kit generate

# Apply migrations
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

#### Clear User Session
```sql
-- Connect to Neon database console
DELETE FROM session WHERE sid = '<session_id>';
```

#### View Active Users
```sql
-- Active sessions in last 24 hours
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sess->>'user'->'id') as active_users
FROM session
WHERE expire > NOW();
```

## üîí Security Hardening (Post-Launch)

### Immediate Security Tasks
- [ ] **Add Helmet.js for Security Headers**
  ```bash
  npm install --save helmet
  ```
  Add to `server/index.ts`:
  ```typescript
  import helmet from 'helmet';
  app.use(helmet());
  ```

- [ ] **Implement Rate Limiting**
  ```bash
  npm install --save express-rate-limit
  ```
  Add to API routes:
  ```typescript
  import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
  const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  });
  app.use('/api/', limiter);
  ```

- [ ] **Enable CSRF Protection**
  - Review if needed for API endpoints
  - Consider for sensitive operations (delete, update)

- [ ] **Input Sanitization Review**
  - Audit all Zod schemas
  - Add sanitization for user-generated content
  - Prevent XSS in displayed data

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] **Weekly Dependency Audits**
  - Run `npm audit` weekly
  - Update dependencies monthly
  - Review security advisories

- [ ] **Access Control Review**
  - Audit user roles and permissions quarterly
  - Review database access logs
  - Rotate API keys every 90 days

- [ ] **Penetration Testing**
  - Schedule annual security audit
  - Use OWASP testing guidelines
  - Document and remediate findings
